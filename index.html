							<p>
								Software Engineer seeking a high-impact role in a fast-paced environment. After close collaboration with
								data scientists and engineers I strive to ensure the applications and services I support have robust
								signaling that is straightforward to consume. I take pride in improving systems I work on.
							</p>
							<p>	
								My most recent interest areas include Mobile development (some iOS, mostly Android), real time streaming
								Audio and Video, analytics and telemetry, experimentation, and data analysis. I also have familiarity with
								Embedded Systems Security, Mobile Security, and Machine Learning. Though I have not applied those skills
								in my day to day operations. I joined Facebook, now Meta, in September of 2020 working for the
								<a href="https://portal.facebook.com">Portal</a> organization in Los Angeles.
							</p>
							<p>
								I served as a member of the Entertainment team at Portal, an iOS engineer on a mobile VR client for
								Workrooms, and specialized in telemetry, experimentation, and configuration for the Quest
								Remote Desktop team.
							</p>
							<p>
								From September of 2018 to August of 2020, I was one the first team members in the Security and Safety
								Things OS application development team at Robert Bosch LLC. based in Pittsburgh PA. It was renamed to
								Azena and ultimately
								<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/06/bosch-shuts-down-its-app-store-for-ai-powered-internet-connected-cameras/">was shut down</a> in 2022.
							</p>
							<p>
								I worked at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in the Secure Resilient Systems and technology group from August 2016 to August 2018. There,
								I researched <a href="https://sel4.systems">security oriented microkernels</a> for small (cube) satellites.
							</p>

						<div id="grad" class="tab-pane fade">
							I earned my Masters degree in 2016 from the Information Networking Institute (INI) at Carnegie Mellon University. I am 
							a member of the 26th graduating class or an "MS26". My advisor was Limin Jia. I was awarded the Scholarship for Service from 
							the National Science Foundation which aims to provide the United States Government with top talent in the field of 
							Computer Security. From 2015-2016 I served as the Events Chair of the Graduate Organization of the INI (GoINI) and 
							was a department representative at Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) meetings. I was also a Teaching Assistant for professors Limin Jia 
							and Nicholas Christin in their Introduction to Computer Security course. In subsequent semesters I also assisted professor Maverick Woo. 
						</div>
						<div id="undergrad" class="tab-pane fade">
							I attended Central Michigan University (Yes, I went to both CMUs) for my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Mathematics. While there
							I performed web development work with the schools Networking department. I participated in the school's first Quiz 
							Bowl team, founded in 2011. I helped orchestrate and write questions for a High School level Quiz Bowl tournament 
							with the other members of my team. I also participated in the Video Game Design Club.
						</div>
						<div id="hobbies" class="tab-pane fade">
							<p>
								In my spare time I enjoy playing strategy games, traveling, bouldering/rock climbing, watching old movies,
								and taking pictures of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_jeffbrandon/">places and things</a>.
							</p>
							<p>
								In college I built a Magic: The Gathering <a href="https://luckypaper.co/what-is-a-cube/">Vintage Cube</a> that I like to draft whenever I can get enough friends around a table.
								I try to keep it up to date <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KE9bF7yEhzhL1DG5il-vQ295OQIVACfctpp4FN-bI9Y">in this google sheet</a>.
